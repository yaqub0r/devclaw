# The Management Science Behind DevClaw

## Why delegation theory matters for AI orchestration

Every developer who's tried to use AI agents for real work hits the same wall. The agent _can_ write code — but reliably managing a backlog, tracking state, coordinating handoffs, and knowing when to escalate? That's a different problem entirely. It's not a coding problem. It's a management problem.

DevClaw exists because of a gap that management theorists identified decades ago: the difference between someone being _able_ to do work and someone _reliably delivering_ work without constant supervision. The entire plugin is, at its core, an encoded delegation framework. This article traces the management principles behind the design and explores what they teach us about saving time for the person behind the keyboard.

## The delegation gap

In 1969, Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard published what would become Situational Leadership Theory. The central idea is deceptively simple: the way you delegate should match the capability and reliability of the person doing the work. You don't hand an intern the system architecture redesign. You don't ask your principal engineer to rename a CSS class.

DevClaw's level selection does exactly this. When a task comes in, the plugin routes it to the cheapest model that can handle it:

| Complexity                       | Level    | Analogy                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Simple (typos, renames, copy)    | Junior   | The intern — just execute   |
| Standard (features, bug fixes)   | Medior   | Mid-level — think and build |
| Complex (architecture, security) | Senior   | The architect — design and reason |

All three roles — DEVELOPER, TESTER, and ARCHITECT — use the same junior/medior/senior scheme (architect uses junior/senior). The orchestrator picks the level per task, and the plugin resolves it to the appropriate model via the role registry and workflow config.

This isn't just cost optimization. It mirrors what effective managers do instinctively: match the delegation level to the task, not to a fixed assumption about the delegate.

## Management by exception

Classical management theory — later formalized by Bernard Bass in his work on Transformational Leadership — introduced a concept called Management by Exception (MBE). The principle: a manager should only be pulled back into a workstream when something deviates from the expected path.

DevClaw's task lifecycle is built on this. The orchestrator delegates a task via `task_start`, then steps away. It only re-engages in specific scenarios:

1. **DEVELOPER completes work** → The label moves to `To Review`. The heartbeat polls PR status. No manual orchestrator involvement is needed on the default path, though intervention policy may wake or steer follow-up when configured.
2. **PR is approved** → The heartbeat auto-merges the PR, closes the issue, and transitions to Done. Pipeline complete. (Or to `To Test` if the test phase is enabled.)
3. **PR has issues** → Comments or changes-requested reviews move the issue to `To Improve`. The scheduler dispatches DEVELOPER on the next tick.
4. **TESTER passes** (test phase only) → The issue closes. Pipeline complete.
5. **Any role is blocked** → The task enters `Refining` — a holding state that _requires human decision_. This is the explicit escalation boundary.

The "Refining" state is the most interesting from a delegation perspective. It's a conscious architectural decision that says: some judgments should not be automated. When a TESTER determines that a task needs rethinking rather than just fixing, or when a DEVELOPER hits an obstacle that requires business context, it escalates to the only actor who has the full picture — the human.

This is textbook MBE. The person behind the keyboard isn't monitoring every task. They're only pulled in when the system encounters something beyond its delegation authority.

## Span of control through standardization

Henry Mintzberg's work on organizational structure identified five coordination mechanisms. The one most relevant to DevClaw is **standardization of work processes** — when coordination happens not through direct supervision but through predetermined procedures that everyone follows.

DevClaw enforces a configurable but consistent lifecycle for every task. The default workflow (human review, no test phase):

```
Planning → To Do → Doing → To Review → PR approved → Done (auto-merge + close)
                                      → PR comments/changes → To Improve → Doing (fix cycle)
                                      → Refining → (human decision)
```

The test phase (To Test → Testing → Done) can be enabled in `workflow.yaml` for automated QA after review. The ARCHITECT role is tool-triggered only via `research_task` — no queue states. Issues go directly to Planning, the architect researches and posts findings, then the issue stays in Planning for human review.

Every label transition, state update, and audit log entry happens atomically inside the plugin. The orchestrator agent cannot skip a step, forget a label, or corrupt session state — because those operations are deterministic code, not instructions an LLM follows imperfectly.

This is what allows a single orchestrator to manage multiple projects simultaneously. Management research has long debated the ideal span of control — typically cited as 5-9 direct reports for knowledge work. DevClaw sidesteps the constraint entirely by making every project follow identical processes. The orchestrator doesn't need to remember how Project A works versus Project B. They all work the same way.

## Trust but verify: structural independence

One of the most common delegation failures is self-review. You don't ask the person who wrote the code to also approve it — not because they're dishonest, but because they're cognitively biased toward their own work.

DevClaw enforces structural separation between development and review by design:

- DEVELOPER and REVIEWER/TESTER are separate sub-agent sessions with separate state.
- Reviewers and testers can use different models entirely, introducing genuine independence.
- Review happens after a clean label transition — the PR is checked in `To Review`, not by watching DEVELOPER work in real time.

By default, all PRs go through human review — the heartbeat polls PR status on GitHub/GitLab and auto-merges when approved. With `reviewPolicy: agent`, an AI reviewer checks every PR. With the optional test phase enabled, a TESTER additionally validates the merged code before closing.

This mirrors a principle from organizational design: effective controls require independence between execution and verification. It's the same reason companies separate their audit function from their operations.

## The economics of context: session reuse

Ronald Coase won a Nobel Prize for explaining why firms exist: transaction costs. Every time you go to the market to hire someone for a task, you pay search costs, negotiation costs, and onboarding costs. Firms exist because keeping people on staff reduces these repeated costs.

DevClaw applies the same logic to AI sessions. Spawning a new sub-agent session costs approximately 50,000 tokens of context loading — the agent needs to read the full codebase before it can do useful work. That's the onboarding cost.

The plugin tracks session keys across task completions. When a DEVELOPER finishes task A and task B is ready on the same project, DevClaw detects the existing session and reuses it instead of spawning a new one. No re-onboarding. No context reload. Each role maintains separate sessions per level, so a "medior developer" session accumulates project context independently from the "senior developer" session.

In management terms: keep your team stable. Reassigning the same person to the next task on their project is almost always cheaper than bringing in someone new — even if the new person is theoretically better qualified.

## The real time savings

Here's what delegation theory reveals about where DevClaw actually saves time. It's not where most people think.

The obvious saving is execution time: AI writes code faster than a human. But that's the smaller gain. The larger saving comes from a concept psychologists call **decision fatigue** — the cumulative cognitive cost of making choices throughout a day.

Without DevClaw, every task requires a human to make a series of small decisions:

- Which model should handle this?
- Is the DEVELOPER session still alive, or do I need a new one?
- What label should this issue have now?
- Did I update the state file?
- Did I log this transition?
- Is the TESTER session free, or is it still working on something?

None of these decisions are hard. But they accumulate. Each one consumes a small amount of the same cognitive resource you need for the decisions that actually matter — product direction, architecture choices, business priorities.

DevClaw eliminates entire categories of decisions by making them deterministic. The plugin picks the model. The plugin manages sessions. The plugin transitions labels. The plugin writes audit logs. The person behind the keyboard is left with only the decisions that require human judgment: what to build, what to prioritize, and what to do when a worker says "this needs rethinking."

This is the deepest lesson from delegation theory: **good delegation isn't about getting someone else to do your work. It's about protecting your attention for the work only you can do.**

## What the theory suggests next

Management research points to a few directions that could extend DevClaw's delegation model:

**Progressive delegation.** Blanchard's model suggests increasing task complexity for delegates as they prove competent. DevClaw could track TESTER pass rates per model level and automatically promote — if junior consistently passes TESTER on borderline tasks, start routing more work to it. This is how good managers develop their people, and it reduces cost over time.

**Delegation authority expansion.** The Vroom-Yetton decision model maps when a leader should decide alone versus consulting the team. Currently, sub-agents have narrow authority — they execute tasks but can't restructure the backlog. Selectively expanding this (e.g., allowing a DEVELOPER agent to split a task it judges too large) would reduce orchestrator bottlenecks, mirroring how managers gradually give high-performers more autonomy.

**Outcome-based learning.** Delegation research emphasizes that the _delegator_ learns from outcomes too. Aggregated metrics — TESTER fail rate by model level, average cycles to Done, time-in-state distributions — would help both the orchestrator agent and the human calibrate their delegation patterns over time.
