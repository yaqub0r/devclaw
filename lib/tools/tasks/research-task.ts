/**
 * research_task — Start a research ticket in "To Research" state and dispatch the architect.
 *
 * The architect picks up the issue, researches, posts findings, and creates
 * implementation tasks via task_create. Then calls work_finish(result="done")
 * which closes the research issue (findings preserved in comments).
 *
 * Flow:
 *   research_task() → issue created in "To Research" → architect dispatched
 *   → architect researches, posts findings with task_comment
 *   → architect creates implementation tasks with task_create (land in Planning)
 *   → architect calls work_finish(result="done") → "Researching" → "Done" (issue closed)
 *   → operator reviews created tasks in Planning, moves to "To Do" when ready

    description: `Spawn an architect to research a design/architecture problem. Creates a "To Research" issue and dispatches an architect worker.

IMPORTANT: Provide a detailed description with enough background context for the architect
to produce actionable, development-ready findings. Include: current state, constraints,
requirements, relevant code paths, and any prior decisions. The output should be detailed
enough for a developer to start implementation immediately.

The architect will:
1. Research the problem systematically (codebase, docs, web)
2. Post findings as comments via task_comment
3. Create implementation tasks via task_create (land in Planning for operator review)
4. Call work_finish(result="done", summary="<recommendation + task numbers>") — closes the research issue
